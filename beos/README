Installation:
=============

See the INSTALL file for details.


Configuring Adonthell:
======================

The first time you run Adonthell, a configuration file is created 
inside the wastesedge-0.3.3 directory. Edit it to customise the game 
to your convenience.

The available options and what they do are:

- Screen-mode
  Whether Adonthell should run fullscreen or in windowed mode 
  0 = Windowed mode, 1 = Fullscreen mode
  
  Due to a bug in SDL, you'll have to switch manually to 640x480 before
  starting Adonthell in Fullscreen mode.
  
- Double-size
  Whether resolution should be scaled to 640x480 or not
  0 = disable, 1 = enable

  You should leave that set to 1 on BeOS.  

- Language [locale]
  Specifies which language to use. As long as this option is unset,
  the language is determined by one of the following environment
  variables: LANG, LC_ALL or LC_MESSAGES. Once the option is set,
  it overrides any environment variable. For a listing of valid
  locale strings, run 'locale -a'.
  
  Of course, the game you run has to provide the translation you 
  chose here, otherwise you'll get the default (i.e. English) text.

  Note that NLS support isn't in the BeOS version. This option is
  therefore useless.

- Quick-load
  Whether the last saved game should be automatically continued at
  startup. Only works if at least one saved game exists.
  0 = disable, 1 = enable

- Audio-channels
  Whether sound should be mono or stereo
  0 = Mono, 1 = Stereo

- Audio-resolution
  Whether audio output should be 8 or 16 bit
  0 = 8 bit, 1 = 16 bit

- Audio-sample-rate
  0 = 11025 Hz, 1 = 22050 Hz, 2 = 44100 Hz

- Audio-volume
  The mixer setting, 0 - 100 %
  
  (Note that a value of 0 will turn audio completely off)


Running Adonthell:
==================

Okay, now you're ready to launch the program. If you have chosen to
install the game, you can start it via the Desktop and Application
menu shortcuts. Otherwise, you'll have to do it via Terminal. Type:

    adonthell <gamename>

to run the game named <gamename>. To get a list of currently 
installed games you can play, type:

    adonthell -l

This will print a list of the installed games you can launch
with above command.

For further information on how to play Adonthell, please refer to the
PLAYING file that comes with the game data.


Release Notes:
==============

The main purpose of this release is to attract new programmers, 
artists and writers in order to shorten the time until the next 
version.  So if you have experience in C++ (and optionally Python), 
or if you are good at computer graphics or writing we would like to
hear from you.  Please have a look at our development site 
  
  http://adonthell.linuxgames.com/development/

for further details.

Adonthell - Waste's Edge -, or v0.3 for short is no complete RPG.
As the v0.3 implies, the engine is far from being finished, although
it should be free of severe bugs.  Missing features include combat, 
items and magic.  But you can interact with NPC's and the game world, 
and the internals enable us to create a basic plot, so v0.3 is actually
playable!

You're greatly invited to report us bugs, problems, or anything you
think we should know. Any feedback is appreciated, so don't hesitate!
