This file describes how to install the binary release of Adonthell -
Waste's Edge for Beos 5 (x86).

Requirements:
=============

Adonthell requires Python 2.2 to be installed. Otherwise it won't run.
You can get it at BeBits:

	http://www.bebits.com/app/2206


Installation:
=============

Once Python is installed, open a Terminal and change into the 
wastesedge-0.3.3 directory. In there, execute

	install-adonthell
	
That's it. Now you'll find shortcuts to Waste's Edge on your Desktop
and your Application menu. Use either of them to launch it.

Note that if you move the wastesedge-0.3.3 directory after the 
installation, you'll have to rerun install-adonthell.


If you'd rather run Waste's Edge from a Terminal, enter

	adonthell wastesedge


To finally remove Adonthell, run the script called uninstall-adonthell.
It will remove those shortcuts from Desktop and Application menu. 
Afterwards you can manually delete the wastesedge-0.3.3 directory.
