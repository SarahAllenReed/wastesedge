<h3>Synopsis</h3>

<p>Below you will find a description of Adonthell's configuration options,
release notes and contact informations. If you need help with playing
Adonthell - Waste's Edge, please refer to the <a href="Playing.html">Playing.html</a> file.<br>&nbsp;<p>

<h3>Philosophy</h3>

<p>Adonthell was (and still is) primarily developed for GNU/Linux, but runs on
many UNiX flavours and various hardware platforms. This is the first
official release for Mac OS X.</p>

<p>Adonthell is free software, which means its source code is available for
everybody to modify and distribute, as long as those modifications
are open to everybody as well. See the <a href="Copying.html">Copying.html</a> file for the exact terms and conditions.</p>

<p>In turn, Adonthell itself depends on various projects that are sharing
the same philosophy, like SDL, Ogg Vorbis, Python and SWIG to name
just a few. Without these fundamental works of dozens of developers,
we wouldn't be where we are today.</p>
</P>

<p>The same is true for the many individuals that contributed bugfixes or
larger portions of the code. Something that would be unthinkable with
closed source software.</p>

<p>In brief: &quot;Use the Source, Luke!&quot;<br>&nbsp;</p>


<h3>Configuring Adonthell</h3>

<p>The Adonthell configuration file is called 'adonthellrc' and located
inside the Adonthell.app package. You can modify it with your favorite
text editor. The available options and what they do are:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Screen-mode</b><br>
Whether Adonthell should run fullscreen or in windowed mode<br>
0 = Windowed mode, 1 = Fullscreen mode<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li><b>Double-size</b><br>
Whether resolution should be scaled to 640x480 or not<br>
0 = disable, 1 = enable<br>
<br>
Enabling double-size mode significantly increases CPU usage. On 
old hardware you should consider turning this option off and run
Adonthell in fullscreen mode instead.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li><b>Language [locale]</b><br>
Specifies which language to use. As long as this option is unset,
the language is determined by one of the following environment
variables: LANG, LC_ALL or LC_MESSAGES. Once the option is
set, it overrides any environment variable.
 
<p>Of course, the game you run has to provide the translation you 
chose here, otherwise you'll get the default (i.e. English) text.</p>

As of today, no translation are available, but French, German and Russian 
are underway. If you are interested in translating Waste's Edge to your 
native language (which is as simple as taking the English sentences and 
writing their translation below them), please contact us!<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li><b>Quick-load</b><br>
Whether the last saved game should be automatically continued at
startup. Only works if at least one saved game exists.<br>
0 = disable, 1 = enable<br>&nbsp;</li>
 
<li><b>Audio-channels</b><br>
Whether sound should be mono or stereo<br>
0 = Mono, 1 = Stereo<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li><b>Audio-resolution</b><br>
Whether audio output should be 8 or 16 bit<br>
0 = 8 bit, 1 = 16 bit<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li><b>Audio-sample-rate</b><br>
0 = 11025 Hz, 1 = 22050 Hz, 2 = 44100 Hz<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li><b>Audio-volume</b><br>
The mixer setting, 0 - 100 %<br><br>
Note that a value of 0 will turn audio completely off.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h3>Release Notes</h3>
<p>The main purpose of this release is to attract new programmers, artists
and writers in order to shorten the time until the next version.  So
if you have experience in C++ (and optionally Python), or if you are
good at computer graphics or writing we would like to hear from you. 
Please have a look at our developer's corner</p>

<p>for further details.</p>

<p>Adonthell - Waste's Edge, or v0.3 for short is no complete RPG. As the v0.3
implies, the engine is far from being finished, although it should be
free of severe bugs.  Missing features include combat, items and
magic.  But you can interact with NPCs and the game world, and the
internals enable us to create a basic plot, so v0.3 is actually
playable!</p>

<p>You're greatly invited to report us bugs, problems, or anything you 
think we should know. Any feedback is appreciated, so don't hesitate!
