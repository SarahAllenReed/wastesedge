Installation:

See the INSTALL file for details.
Note that this package is designed to run along with the adonthell
game engine version 0.3. Therefore, you need it installed or you'll
be stuck at configure time. If you don't have it, download it from
http://adonthell.linuxgames.com.


Running Adonthell - Waste's Edge:
=================================

If the installation process is successfull, you're ready to play.
You can play by invoking 'adonthell wastesedge' but there is a little
shell script named 'adonthell-wastesedge' that will do the work for 
you.


The Story So Far:
=================


Release Notes:
==============

Adonthell - Waste's Edge -, or v0.3 for short is no complete RPG.
It can be considered a technology demo, to show what our current 
engine can do.  This also helps us to locate problems with the engine
and our development tools.

As the v0.3 implies, the engine is not complete, although it should
be free of severe bugs.  Missing features include combat, items and 
magic.  But you can interact with NPC's and the game world, and the
internals enable us to create a basic plot, so v0.3 is actually
playable!

You're greatly invited to report us bugs, problems, or anything you
think we should now. Any feedback is appreciated, so don't hesitate!
