Instructions:

1) Edit the *.xcf files to create your desired walls.
For your convenience the various surfaces and associated outlines have been
split into separate layers. Be aware of how the pieces can be combined and
ensure that touching edges can be tiled seamlessly.

2) Export your finished work as PNG files.
Note that PNGs of the XCFs have already been provided as a reference. You
should overwrite these with your own graphics.
In Gimp you can use "Save a Copy...", choose PNG as the format and select
"Merge Visible Layers" in the "Export File" dialog (this preserves any
transparent pixels).
For the corner parts ("ins-I**" and "ins-O**") you will need to additionally
break up your image into two separate PNGs: One for the vertical section of
the corner and one for the horizontal part. It is recommended that you split
in the same way as the reference PNGs.
