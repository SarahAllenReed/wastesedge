    strings = ["This is seemingly the Innkeeper and owner of the place. He appears to be lost in thought and from his eyes you can see that he hasn't slept much lately. His worried face brightens up though as you approach, and his voice is warm and friendly:", "Welcome to Waste's Edge, traveller. Here you shall find the pleasures of a hot meal and bath if you desire. And safe and comfortable lodging. Although, I fear, this is no longer granted for sure. You've chosen troublesome times for your visit.", "Now that I come to think of it, I hope Talan at the gate didn't cause you any trouble either. He has orders to let nobody pass through. But it seems he has enough common sense to make an exception for a respectable traveller at least.", "But excuse me sir, I talk and talk and haven't even introduced myself. Orloth's the name, sir. Orloth Redwyne, I'm the landlord here at Waste's Edge. Just speak your wishes and I'll see to it.", "Well, right now I'd be interested in those troubles you talked about. The guard said something about a theft, but it made not much sense.", "'Tis a shame, really. You'd think you were in danger on the road, with all those bandits about. But no, right here, despite the guards, a mans belongings aren't safe from filthy thieves.", "And do you know what bothers me the most? It's no obvious bad types doing this, but people like you and me, if I may say so. An elvish Lady even! Where to will this lead, I ask!", "That Talan told me the same. And yet I cannot quite believe it. I know Lady Silverhair for years, and she would never do anything unsavoury.", "Excuse my interest, but I had to promise that I help with resolving this matter before Talan let me in. So what exactly happened?", "That's a relief to hear, sir. Don't get me wrong, Talan is a good lad, and Jelom is surely doing his duty, but they seem a bit overtaxed with the situation. And it may take days before an officer from Cirdanth arrives.", "I certainly will sleep much better when this business is sorted out. So how may I be of your assistence?", "Could you tell me a little about your guests?", "Just tell me what exactly happened here, would you?", "Of course. Well, you may have met Lady Frostbloom in the yard already. She's an artist. Says the wilderness inspires her, so she stays here regularly. I think she is the only person around not concerned about the theft. She's never paying much attention to anything but her work.", "My apologies, sir, but it is nonetheless true. But since you know her, maybe you could talk some sense into her. It'd be much easier for all parties if she would hand out the gems.", "I do indeed intend to resolve these matters Master Redwyne. But I think the outcome mght surprise some of the people here.", "That may be as it will. I for one would be glad if only this business gets sorted out, either way. So how can I be of your assistence, sir?", "Still she's a nice person if you get to know her, unlike the black clad fellow over there. Alek Endhelm, a mercenary from the North. I don't know much about him, but I do not trust him. Selling his loyality for money. His heart must be as black as his clothing.", "But what can I do about it? He's paying for his room, although he insisted on a cheap one down the cellar. And as long as he's behaving, I can but keep an eye on him. You should beware of him as well, if I may advice you, sir.", "No worries. I've delt with his likes before. So who else is here, then?", "Thank you Master Redwyne. I think I have heard enough of this.", "The young Dwarf in the common room is Erek Stonebreaker, the apprentice of Master Fingolson. He acts quite reserved when his Master is around, but I think he really enjoys the company of other people.", "Too bad Fingolson does not share his views. He's a regular visitor, but I've never seen him mingle with other guests much. A quiet and earnest character, usually. Although, the day Lady Silverhair arrived, he made some remarks about her that did not sound much like him.", "What exactly did Fingolson say?", "I'm sorry, but I don't remember the words. A little jest about Elves or somesuch. I was quite busy that afternoon with the inn crowded like that. There was the two Dwarves, Silverhair and her servants, Frostbloom, Endhelm, and a merchant from Cirdanth, Tristan Illig.", "And that healer, Kezular, asking me questions about everyone else. I really hadn't much time to follow the conversations", "Kezular and that merchant, Illig; are they still here?", "Oh yes. Illig sits over there. He was waiting here at the post to meet his caravan. But when it moved by this morning, he wasn't allowed to leave. You see, as long as those stolen gems are not retrieved, nobody is to leave the place.", "And Fellnir Kezular trades in medicine and gossip, it seems. He mostly stays up in his room. From what I've heard, he must have had a confrontation with the mercenary. I guess Alek didn't like Kezular's nosy ways.", "And that is all the people staying here right now?", "That was all the guests. Then there's my wife, Lucia and Oliver, our son. They help to keep this place running. And, of course, there are the guards. They are here to keep order, and usually their presence is enough ...", "I'm still dismayed at such an act of  crime commited under my roof. I really hope your inquiries help to put the {thief} just punishment. So if I can do anything to help, please name it.", "So are you interested in anything else then?", "So it be. Lady Silverhair had an appointment with Bjarn Fingolson to buy some gems, as I understand. That is nothing unusual. Since Waste's Edge lies about halfway between Cirdanth and the mines of Uzdun'kal, much business with Dwarfs is done here.", "Anyway, they sat together in the little parlour next to the common room in the evening, but it wasn't long when we heard them arguing. You might want to ask Erek what had happened before the shouting started. As Fingolsons apprentice he was in there with them.", "I didn't pay much attention, since it was really not my business, but when Lady Silverhair finally rushed out and headed to her room without another word, I got a little curious myself. Shortly afterwards Master Fingolson and Erek appeared and everybody gathered around them to learn about the argument. Fingolson left quickly, but poor Erek didn't get away that easily", "When I finally managed to calm people down, Fingolson reappeared, still enraged as it seemed. He pulled Erek away from the crowd and ordered him to pack their luggage, as he was going to leave in the morning \"without selling to the greedy elf\", as he said. Then he turned to us others, let out a rant about Elves and their unseemly manners and marched off down the stairs.", "Of course I was surprised how this turned out, but then again, Silverhair and Fingolsin didn't get along too well right from the beginning. They simply weren't the right business partners, I thought and left it to that.", "They didn't get along too well, you say? How come?", "And what happened next?", "As I said, Master Fingolson made some jest about Silverhair when she arrived. She seemed to ignore it, but I guess it angered her. She appears to be a rather serious woman, not inclined to humor.", "She certainly wouldn't like a Dwarf to make fun of her. But go on, what happened next?", "I guess it's partly Fingolsons fault. When Lady Silverhair arrived he made some remark about her, a harmless jest about Elves, if I recall. But it seems she didn't take well to this kind of humor.", "Well that's been it for that day. It was late already and people went off to bed quickly afterwards. The other morning though, when I was just serving breakfast to the early risen, Master Fingolson stormes into the common room, face red with anger and starts babbling about his gems gone missing.", "But maybe I've missed something. I hadn't much time to follow their conversation, with all those people keeping me busy. Apart from the Dwarves, Lady Silverhair, Frostbloom, and that mercenary there was Tristan Illig, a merchant from Cirdanth and Fellnir Kezular, a healer of some sort. That is more guests than we usually have at one time.", "Too bad that Fingolson does not share his views. I still wonder how he became a tradesman. I never seen him truly enjoy any company. But he is as honourable as any Dwarf, from what I know. That's why I'm still a little surprised by his reaction towards Lady Silverhair.", "To tell the truth, sir, I couldn't believe it at first. Sure, Fingolson is a regular guest, and a respectable one, no doubt. But we all know how easily a small packet might slip into the wrong pouch or gets buried under the rest of the luggage. After all, who would commit a theft under the watchful eyes of our guards?", "But alas, I've been proven wrong. Fingolson assured us that he and Erek had double checked everything. You probably can imagine the uproar starting now. The guards were fetched and everyone awaken to find out who's on the run with the jewels.", "But quite surprisingly, nobody was missing. Well, the gates are locked during the night, and guarded as well, but that wouldn't have been a problem for a determined thief, I suppose. Unless, of course, he or she was well known, just as {your}Lady Silverhair, and therefore wouldn't get away that easily.", "Now *that's* an argument for her guilt, is it!", "Excuse me sir! I'm simply telling you what common sense suggests. There were other clues too, of course. Nearly everyone had heard the argument between Silverhair and Fingolson, and she had to admit that she was in need of the gems. And what with Fingolson threatening to leave in the morning ...", "I imagine she was pretty desperate, and she had reasons to despise Fingolson. And who, if not an elf could possibly sneak into a room unnoticed by two people sleeping inside?", "You actually believe that, do you? But since Fingolsons gems obviously weren't found on her, I find this quite far-fetched.", "Ah. See, that's where the trouble is. Lady Silverhair wouldn't have it, that her room be searched. I would be glad to believe in her innocence, but you have to agree that her behaviour was highly suspicious. And you should have heard what she swore to do to the first person to touch her posessions.", "She made quite an impression on the poor guards, and who is to argue with an elvish noble? That turned out to be a bit of a dilemma though. Lady Silverhair is the prime suspect, but as long as the gems remain hidden, there is uncertainity.", "The only solution was to keep everybody inside the post, so the jewels couldn't be smuggled outside. Lady Silverhair was confined to her room, and Bregon, one of the guards, was sent to Erinsforst to fetch an officer from the garrison there. We're hoping that he can deal with Lady Silverhair.", "That's how things stand. But now that you are here, I hope this mess gets resolved quickly. So is there anything else you like to know, sir?", "Not now. You have given me plenty to think about already, Master Redwyne.", "Ah, any news about the thief, $name?", "I am $name, Lady Silverhair's clerk.", "$name, from Cirdanth.", "I wish you luck with your inquiries then, uh ... what was the name again, sir?", "Well then, $name, now we've got to find you a room. We're practically full up to the roof. Although number 2 on the first floor is still available. Perhaps not the most suitable for you sir, but it'll have to do.", "Thank you Master Redwyne. After the long journey, any room will do, as long as it has a proper bed. Now if you'll excuse me ...", "That's Lucia, all right. Did she go on about Lenhart again? My oldest brother, you know. Inherited the inn from our father, although he never really liked it out here.", "That's why he asked me to buy it. See, I was a carter's apprentice in Erinsforst back then, and the prospect of taking over at Waste's Edge instead was very appealing. Lucia and I had just married, and the dowry would have nearly paid for the inn.", "Oh, forgive me, $name. I'm forgetting myself. Lucia's right when she says I'm talking too much. Not that she is much better in that respect, even if she denies it. But enough of her. There must be other things you want to know.", "I'm making progress, but I still need more information.", "Well, I'll do my best to be of some help. Just ask your questions.", "I don't mean to pry, but I couldn't help to notice your wife's dislike of Waste's Edge.", "I'd like to hear about the theft again, Master Redwyne.", "Sure. Where shall I begin?", "I'd like to know what happened before the theft.", "But I wouldn't be sad if you could clear up this mess before he arrives. The sooner this place returns to normal, the better. Now have you got any other questions?", "Could you tell me a little about your guests?", "I see. Can I help you with something else then?", "I have a few more questions about the people here.", "Please start with Lady Silverhair's arrival.", "I'd like to hear the bit about the argument again.", "How was the theft discovered again, Master Redwyne?", "She came shortly before lunchhour, so a number of guests were gathered in the common room. Silverhair took place next to the Dwarfs and Fingolson leaned over to talk to her.", "As I have said already, I don't know what he said. But that Alek fellow burst out laughing, so it must have been a jest of some sort. Whatever it was, Lady Silverhair didn't enjoy it. To me it looked like she couldn't stand Master Fingolson from the beginning.", "The more I think about it, the less the outcome surprises me. I have never noticed Dwarves and Elves getting along any worse than other people here, but in the case of Fingolson and Silverhair, the cliche seems to fit.", "But it's too late to think about this. The theft already happened and talking won't convict the thief. So ... where was I?", "The argument between the two.", "How was the theft discovered?", "I think you were finished.", "Ah, the argument; let's see. Master Fingolson and Lady Silverhair sat together in the parlour to discuss their business in private. I don't know what they talked first--young Erek might tell you--but it didn't take long before we heard them shouting.", "And not long afterward, Silverhair left the room in a bad mood and swept up the stairs without another word. I tell you, nobody felt like bothering her at that moment!", "Anyway, a minute later, the Dwarves appeared. Fingolson headed straight for his room, but that nosy Kezular threw himself at his apprentice. Young Erek didn't look happy at all, but he's too good-natured to turn the healer away.", "They didn't talk long, though, since Fingolson returned and send Erek to pack their luggage. He did not keep his voice down, so everyone could hear that he would leave with the first light of dawn, without selling anything to Silverhair.", "I have never seen Master Fingolson so enraged and emotional. I don't know what she said to him, but it must have angered him a lot. After sending Erek away, he made some rude comments about Elves and their way to do business, then he marched off.", "He was practically fuming with rage. Whatever the argument was about, it must have hurt him deeply.", "And what about the theft? How was that discovered, then?", "Thank you Master Redwyne, that's all I wanted to hear.", "That was in the morning. As I told you, Fingolson was going to leave early. As he told us, he and Erek were going through their luggage to see whether everything was well packed up, and there they found the gems gone.", "Perhaps you better speak with Fingolson or Erek yourself, since I can only tell what I heard of them. But it seens that somebody sneaked into their room during the night and took them away.", "However, once the guards were fetched and everyone gathered in the common room, it turned out that nobody had noticed anything, and nobody had left Waste's Edge either.", "That was creepy, I tell you. To know that the thief was amongst us at that moment. But I had never thought that it would be the Lady Silverhair!", "Why was the Lady Silverhair accused of the theft?", "And that argument was the sole reason to accuse Lady Silverhair of the theft?", "What made the guards think that she commited the theft?", "Of course it meant convincing Lucia, and that, as you might guess, was no easy task. I'm still a bit puzzled how my brother managed it, but in the end she gave in to him. It's something she can't forgive, although I am not sure whom she blames more: herself or Lenhart.", "She likes running the Inn, no doubt. But her dream is to move business to Cirdanth, to civilization, as she says. Not that she would find nothing to complain about in the city. Otherwise she wouldn't be the Lucia I love.", "Isn't that obvious? She had an interest into these gems, and, as it turned out, didn't like Master Fingolsons offer. She didn't like Master Fingolson either.", "Of course she denied stealing the gems and declared it below her dignity. But she didn't allow the guards to search her room, and why would she do that if she had nothing to hide?", "Of course not. The main reason was that she wanted those gems, but, as it turned out, she didn't want to pay Fingolson's price. And she admitted that she didn't like him. So she had a motive.", "To be honest, everybody could be the thief. That's why nobody may leave until the gems are retrieved. But all the facts point to Lady Silverhair.", "Very well. Is there something else you wish to know then, $name?", "That's all for now, Master Redwyne. I don't want to keep you off your work any longer.", "I fear there aren't. I'm still at the beginning of my investigations.", ""]
