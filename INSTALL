Requirements:
=============
To install the Waste's Edge data package you need to have the adonthell 
game engine version 0.3 installed. The configure script will check this 
for you, but you can check can check whether you're ok or not by typing:

$> adonthell -v

This should print '0.3' and exit.


Installing:
===========

In the toplevel wastesedge-0.3 directory type

$> ./configure
$> make

and (as root)

$> make install

For more information, see the README file.

You can then check whether the game is correctly installed by invoking
'adonthell -l', which should list 'wastesedge'.

Then, typing 'adonthell wastesedge' or simply 'adonthell-wastesedge' will
get you into the game.
