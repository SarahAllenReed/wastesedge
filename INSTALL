Requirements:
=============
To install the Waste's Edge data package you need to have the adonthell 
game engine version 0.3.3 installed. The configure script will check this 
for you, but you can check whether you're ok or not by typing:

$> adonthell -v

This should print '0.3.3' and exit.


Installing:
===========

From source:
------------

In the toplevel wastesedge-0.3.3 directory type

$> ./configure
$> make

and (as root)

$> make install

For more information, see the README file.


Debian users:
-------------

You can automatically get an installable Debian package by typing

$> debuild 

within the wastesedge-0.3.3 directory. 'debbuild' is part of the
'devscripts' package. You'll need a properly installed 'adonthell' 
package of course, which you can get from Adonthell's sources.

You can then check whether the game is correctly installed by invoking
'adonthell -l', which should list 'wastesedge'.

Then, typing 'adonthell wastesedge' or simply 'adonthell-wastesedge' will
get you into the game.


RPM users:
----------

To create an installable RPM package, type

$> rpm -tb wastesedge-0.3.3.tar.gz

Note that the 4.x versions of rpm are currently unsupported. Feel free
to change that, if you want.
