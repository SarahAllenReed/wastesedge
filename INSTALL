Requirements:
=============
To install the Waste's Edge data package you need to have the Adonthell 
game engine version 0.3.3 or later installed. In order to make use of
the included true type font you'll need at least version 0.3.4.

Note that this package won't work with Adonthell >= 0.4.


Installing:
===========

From source:
------------

In the toplevel wastesedge-0.3.4 directory type

$> ./configure
$> make

and (as root)

$> make install

For more information, see the README file.


Debian users:
-------------

You can automatically get an installable Debian package by typing

$> debuild 

within the wastesedge-0.3.4 directory. 'debbuild' is part of the
'devscripts' package. You'll need a properly installed 'adonthell' 
package of course, which you can get from Adonthell's sources.

You can then check whether the game is correctly installed by invoking
'adonthell -l', which should list 'wastesedge'.

Then, typing 'adonthell wastesedge' or simply 'adonthell-wastesedge' will
get you into the game.


RPM users:
----------

To create an installable RPM package, type

$> rpm -tb wastesedge-0.3.4.tar.gz

Note that the 4.x versions of rpm are currently unsupported. Feel free
to change that, if you want.
