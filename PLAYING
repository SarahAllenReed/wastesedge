How to play this game!
======================

Dunno what you're supposed to do in "Adonthell - Waste's Edge"?
Well, you've come to the right place to find out!


Aim of the game
===============

As a loyal servant of the elven Lady Silverhair, you arrive at the remote
trading post of Waste's Edge, where she is engaged in negotiations with the
dwarish merchant Bjarn Fingolson. But not all is well at Waste's Edge, and
soon you are confronted with circumstances that are about to destroy your
mistress' high reputation. And you are the only one to avert this ...

Remember this game is a demo of what we can do so far. There is no fighting
or collecting items yet (this will appear in future releases) so you must
solve this quest by exploring the Redwyne Inn where everyone is staying and 
talking to the people you meet there.

The story is explained in more detail in the intro sequence so DON'T skip 
it the first time you play :P
